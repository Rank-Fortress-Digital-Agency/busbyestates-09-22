                    When you need the services of an Orlando estate auction company, you may not know where to begin. Here are some questions to ask before making your choice.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At certain points in life, you may have a need to liquidate material assets. It could be after the loss of a loved one, or in the case that you need to downsize. When you need to part with a large number of household items, you may need to hold an Orlando estate auction. Asking <a href="https://busbyestates.com/blog/orlando-estate-liquidation/">professionals</a> to handle this process is a simple way to clear out a living space so that you and your family can move on to other tasks. Ask these questions when looking to hire an auction service.

                <h2>
                    What is the difference between an estate sale and an estate auction?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Estate sale</b> – This type of sale usually takes place over a few days. The estate sale representative will categorize, display, and price each item. The company will also advertise the sale and handle money during the sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Estate auction</b> – An estate auction may begin the same way as an estate sale. Items will be categorized and displayed. Since the Orlando estate auction is usually a one-day event, the estate auction company will advertise the date and time of the auction. Prior to the auction, buyers will have the opportunity to view the items and pick up a numbered auction paddle. Prices for each item will be determined by the highest bid. An Orlando estate auction could also have bidders online during the event.

                        <li>
                            <b>Higher prices</b> – Bidding often encourages buyers to spend more on items

                        <p>
                            Since an Orlando estate auction is a one-day event, it’s crucial to the success of the sale that many buyers attend. There are several ways to spread the word and increase the chances of higher bids.
                        </p>
                        <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">

                                <b>Online ads </b>– Your estate auction partner likely has a way to set up an online advertising campaign. Including photos of the bigger-ticket items will drive interest in your sale. Allowing bidders to participate online will also increase sales during your auction.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Local ads</b> – Advertising in the local newspaper will reach a wide audience. Buyers are always looking for sales taking place in their area. Newspaper ads are a great way to get local buyers to attend your auction.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Neighborhood ads</b> – Putting up signs around the neighborhood and advertising on your neighborhood social media pages will help spread the word nearby.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Direct mail</b> – Depending on the size of your sale and the number of valuable items included, a direct mail campaign can bring people in who may have been missed by your other marketing efforts. Buyers from neighboring cities can travel into town for the day of your event.
                            </li>
